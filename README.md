# Web_project_Tkachuk
    Temporary version README

Create API to display time of the take-off and landing  the aircraft with weather data at that time

  - Create API call to display all flights within the specified time interval
  - Create API call to display all information (including weather) for a specific flight
  - Create a task for downloading data from the API at 2 a.m. every day (that is, the select task 
  will be launched to download all the information we need about the weather and flights from the api 
  to the database)
  - Make versioning for API (like in the first version there will be information about flights and 
  weather, and in the second information about flights and weather and the ozone layer)
